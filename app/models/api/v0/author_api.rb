							:description => "Billy Corgan has announced that he will be performing an 
							eight-hour jam inspired by the Herman Hesse novella Siddhartha. The all-day 
							ambient show will be presented at his Chicago tea shop on 28 February.

							The Smashing Pumpkins bandleader shared concert details by posting on Faceauthor
							 (via Stereogum). [The] performance will be centered around an ambient/musical 
							 interpretation of [the author] ... built by modular synthesis, on the fly, he 
							 wrote. Readings of the text [will] go hand in hand with whatever is created.
							  The show will begin at noon and last between eight and nine hours.

							Said tea shop, Madame ZuZus, was launched in 2012. Corgan described it then 
							as a salon ... [where] like-minded people can discuss ideas and performance 
							art. From the start, Corgan emphasised that he wanted this space to be a 
							showcase for literature, including his own poetry; he admitted to the Chicago 
							Tribune that he has been writing a spiritual memoir since around 2010.

							Indeed, Corgan is one of those 30m-album-selling rockers for whom an eight-hour 
							Buddhist synth jam seems par for the course. Before his tea shop, the 46-year-old 
							launched a religion/philosophy website called Everything From Here To There. He 
							also became a wrestling promoter. And although many critics might mock Corgans 
							pretense, his fans have his back: Hes just hanging out at his tea shop playing 
							music, one wrote on Faceauthor. How is that pretentious?",

						:summary => "Hermann Hesse was a German-Swiss poet, novelist, and painter. In 
						1946, he received the Nobel Prize in Literature. His best known works include 
						Steppenwolf, Siddhartha, and The Glass Bead Game (also known as Magister Ludi) 
						which explore an individual's search for spirituality outside society.

						Hesse was born in the Black Forest town of Calw to a Christian missionary family. 
						Both of his parents served with a Basel Mission to India, where Hesse's mother 
						Marie Gundert was born in 1842. Hesse's father, Johannes Hesse, was born in 1877 
						in Estonia, the son of a doctor. The Hesse family had lived in Calw since 1873, 
						where they operated a missionary publishing house under the direction of Hesse's 
						grandfather, Hermann Gundert.

						Hesse spent his first years of life surrounded by the spirit of Swabian piety. 
						In 1880 the family moved to Basel, Switzerland, for six years, then returned to 
						Calw. After successful attendance at the Latin School in Gppingen, Hesse began 
						to attend the Evangelical Theological Seminary in Maulbronn in 1891. Here in 
						March 1892, Hesse showed his rebellious character and in one instance he fled 
						from the Seminary and was found in a field a day later.

						During this time, Hesse began a journey through various institutions and schools, 
						and experienced intense conflicts with his parents. In May, after an attempt at 
						suicide, he spent time at an institution in Bad Boll under the care of theologian 
						and minister Christoph Friedrich Blumhardt. Later he was placed in a mental 
						institution in Stetten im Remstal, and then a boys' institution in Basel.

						In the early summer of 1894, he began a fourteen month mechanic apprenticeship 
						at a clock tower factory in Calw. The monotony of soldering and filing work made 
						him resolve to turn himself toward more spiritual activities. In October 1895, 
						he was ready to begin wholeheartedly a new apprenticeship with a authorseller in 
							Tbingen. This experience from his youth he returns to later in his novel, 
							Beneath the Wheel.

						On October 17, 1895, Hesse began working in the authorshop Heckenhauer in Tbingen, 
						which had a specialized collection in theology, philology, and law. Hesse's 
						assignment there consisted of organizing, packing, and archiving the authors. 
						After the end of each twelve hour workday, Hesse pursued his own work further, 
						and he spent his long, idle Sundays with authors rather than friends. Hesse 
						studied theological writings, and later Goethe, Lessing, Schiller, and several 
						texts on Greek mythology. In 1896, his poem 'Madonna' appeared in a Viennese 
						periodical.

						By 1898, Hesse had a respectable income that enabled his financial independence 
						from his parents. During this time, he concentrated on the works of the German 
						Romantics, including much of the work from Clemens Brentano, Joseph Freiherr 
						von Eichendorff, Friedrich Holderlin and Novalis. In letters to his parents, 
						he expressed a belief that \"the morality of artists is replaced by aesthetics.\"

						In the fall, Hesse released his first small volume of poetry, Romantic Songs 
						and in the summer of 1899, a collection of prose, entitled One Hour After 
						Midnight. Both works were a business failure. In two years, only 54 of the 600 
						printed copies of the former were sold, and the latter received only one printing 
						and sold sluggishly. Nevertheless, the Leipzig publisher Eugen Diederichs was 
						convinced of the literary quality of the work and from the beginning regarded 
						the publications more as encouragement of a young author than as profitable 
						business.",
